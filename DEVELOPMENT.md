#### shared.py

Defines the `SharedData` class that holds configuration settings, paths, and methods for updating and managing shared data across different modules.

#### init_shared.py

#### webapp.py

Sets up and runs a web server to provide a web interface for changing settings, monitoring and interacting with your-pax.

### ▶️ Actions

#### actions/scanning.py

Conducts network scanning to identify live hosts and open ports. It updates the network knowledge base (`netkb`) and generates scan results.

#### actions/nmap_vuln_scanner.py

Performs vulnerability scanning using Nmap. It parses the results and updates the vulnerability summary for each host.

#### Protocol Connectors

- **ftp_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on FTP services.
- **ssh_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on SSH services.
- **smb_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on SMB services.
- **rdp_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on RDP services.
- **telnet_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on Telnet services.
- **sql_connector.py**: Brute-force attacks on SQL services.

#### File Stealing Modules

- **steal_files_ftp.py**: Steals files from FTP servers.
- **steal_files_smb.py**: Steals files from SMB shares.
- **steal_files_ssh.py**: Steals files from SSH servers.
- **steal_files_telnet.py**: Steals files from Telnet servers.
- **steal_data_sql.py**: Extracts data from SQL databases.
 
### 📇 Data Structure

#### Network Knowledge Base (netkb.csv)

Located at `data/netkb.csv`. Stores information about:

- Known hosts and their status. (Alive or offline)
- Open ports and vulnerabilities.
- Action execution history. (Success or failed)

**Preview Example:**

![netkb1](https://github.com/your-pax/your-pax/assets/37984399/f641a565-2765-4280-a7d7-5b25c30dcea5)
![netkb2](https://github.com/your-pax/your-pax/assets/37984399/f08114a2-d7d1-4f50-b1c4-a9939ba66056)

#### Scan Results

Located in `data/output/scan_results/`.
This file is generated everytime the network is scanned. It is used to consolidate the data and update netkb.

**Example:**

![Scan result](https://github.com/your-pax/your-pax/assets/37984399/eb4a313a-f90c-4c43-b699-3678271886dc)

## 📖 Detailed Project Description

### 👀 Behavior of your-pax

Once launched, your-pax performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Loads configuration, initializes shared data, and sets up necessary components such as the e-Paper HAT display.
2. **Network Scanning**: Scans the network to identify live hosts and open ports. Updates the network knowledge base (`netkb`) with the results.
3. **Orchestration**: Orchestrates different actions based on the configuration and network knowledge base. This includes performing vulnerability scanning, attacks, and file stealing.
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Performs vulnerability scans on identified hosts and updates the vulnerability summary.
5. **Brute-Force Attacks and File Stealing**: Starts brute-force attacks and steals files based on the configuration criteria.
6. **Display Updates**: Continuously updates the e-Paper HAT display with current information such as network status, vulnerabilities, and various statistics. your-pax also displays random comments based on different themes and statuses.
7. **Web Server**: Provides a web interface for monitoring and interacting with your-pax.

## ▶️ Running your-pax

### 📗 Manual Start

To manually start your-pax (without the service, ensure the service is  stopped « sudo systemctl stop your-pax.service »):

```bash
cd ~/your-pax  # or wherever you cloned the repo

# Run your-pax
sudo python your-pax.py
```

### 🕹️ Service Control

Control the your-pax service:

```bash
# Start your-pax
sudo systemctl start your-pax.service

# Stop your-pax
sudo systemctl stop your-pax.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status your-pax.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u your-pax.service
```

### 🪄 Fresh Start

To reset your-pax to a clean state:

```bash
sudo rm -rf config/*.json \
    data/*.csv \
    data/*.log \
    data/output/data_stolen/* \
    data/output/crackedpwd/* \
    config/* \
    data/output/scan_results/* \
    __pycache__ \
    config/__pycache__ \
    data/__pycache__ \
    actions/__pycache__ \
    resources/__pycache__ \
    web/__pycache__ \
    *.log \
    resources/waveshare_epd/__pycache__ \
    data/logs/* \
    data/output/vulnerabilities/* \
    data/logs/*

```

Everything will be recreated automatically at the next launch of your-pax.

## ❇️ Important Configuration Files

### 🔗 Shared Configuration (`shared_config.json`)

Defines various settings for your-pax, including:

- Boolean settings (`manual_mode`, `websrv`, `debug_mode`, etc.).
- Time intervals and delays.
- Network settings.
- Port lists and blacklists.
These settings are accessible on the webpage.

### 🛠️ Actions Configuration (`actions.json`)

Lists the actions to be performed by your-pax, including (dynamically generated with the content of the folder):

- Module and class definitions.
- Port assignments.
- Parent-child relationships.
- Action status definitions.

## 📟 E-Paper Display Support

Currently, hardcoded for the 2.13-inch V2 & V4 e-Paper HAT. 
My program automatically detect the screen model and adapt the python expressions into my code.

For other versions:
- As I don't have the v1 and v3 to validate my algorithm, I just hope it will work properly.

### 🍾 Ghosting Removed!
In my journey to make your-pax work with the different screen versions, I struggled, hacking several parameters and found out that it was possible to remove the ghosting of screens! I let you see this, I think this method will be very useful for all other projects with the e-paper screen!

## ✍️ Development Guidelines

### ➕ Adding New Actions

1. Create a new action file in `actions/`.
2. Implement required methods:
   - `__init__(self, shared_data)`
   - `execute(self, ip, port, row, status_key)`
3. Add the action to `actions.json`.
4. Follow existing action patterns.

### 🧪 Testing

1. Create a test environment.
2. Use an isolated network.
3. Follow ethical guidelines.
4. Document test cases.

## 💻 Web Interface

- **Access**: `http://[device-ip]:8000`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring with a console.
  - Configuration management.
  - Viewing results. (Credentials and files)
  - System control.

## 🧭 Project Roadmap

### 🪛 Current Focus

- Stability improvements.
- Bug fixes.
- Service reliability.
